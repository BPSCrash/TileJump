# :snowboarder: Tile Jump!

Jump! Shoot! Escape! Go for Score or go for Style in this brutal platformer that will test your skills! <br />
A simple sprite shape level with some particle systems, follow camera, all propelled by a Surface Effector.

## :keyboard: How to use

- Left/Right Arrow keys to rotate :arrows_clockwise:
- Up Arrow to get a speed boost while on ground :sparkles::athletic_shoe:
- Reach the finish line :checkered_flag:

## :camera_flash: Caught in (almost) 4K
For this project I learned about particle systems, and using cinemachine.
